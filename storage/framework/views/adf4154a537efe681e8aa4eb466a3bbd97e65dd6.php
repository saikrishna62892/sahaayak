From time to time, Sahaayak may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p align="justify">Sahaayak also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://sahaayakdemo.herokuapp.com blog posts.

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p align="justify">To enrich and perfect your online experience, Sahaayak uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
<p align="justify">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Sahaayak uses cookies to help Sahaayak identify and track visitors, their usage of http://sahaayakdemo.herokuapp.com, and their website access preferences. Sahaayak visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Sahaayak's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Sahaayak's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<p align="justify">By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Sahaayak's use of cookies.</p>

<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p align="justify">If Sahaayak, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Sahaayak goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Sahaayak may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p align="justify">Although most changes are likely to be minor, Sahaayak may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Sahaayak's sole discretion. Sahaayak encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<h4>When will I need to provide my details</h4>
<p align="justify">We may collect personal information (for example your name, your address, your date birth, or your telephone number) from you when you:
(a) Become one of our members;
(b)Contact us or become involved with us in another way, for example with our governance, as a volunteer, or as a media volunteer.</p>


<h4>Why do you ask for information about my interest in mental health</h4>
<p align="justify">Sometimes we may ask you what your link is to mental illness. For example if you have a mental illness yourself, or if a friend or relative of yours does, or if you have another connection to mental illness. We ask for this information simply so that we can understand more about people who support us. It can help us to provide you with information that is more relevant to you; it can help us represent you better in our campaigning work; and it helps us ensure we are carrying out Equality and Diversity best practice, and best practice within our own governance. If you are happy for us to keep this information we will treat it with strict confidence. If you do not want us to have this information you do not need to supply it.
If we have other sensitive information about you (eg your mental health diagnosis because we have supported you through one of our services), this information is also kept in strict confidence only those members of staff who need to see or report on this information can see it.</p>


<h4> How long will you keep my data</h4>
<p align="justify">We will keep data for only as long as it makes sense to do - so this becomes more important after you end your membership or other contact with us, for example. Legally we need to keep some records (financial or in relation to care services) in case there is a query.
In most cases we won't totally delete a record of you (see note below in the next section.)</p>


<h4> What if I don't want you to use my details anymore</h4>
<p align="justify">If you don't want us to hold your data at all anymore, we have a duty to let you know that the best way for us to be sure we don't contact you again is to minimise the data we hold (e.g. reduce it to name and last known address) and then 'block' those details from contact rather than delete them completely. It's best practice (from the Information Commissioner's Office) to hold 'suppressed' records rather than to delete completely, so that we can make sure we're never able to accidentally acquire a person's details again - that way we can recognise the address and prevent contact to it.
If you have a special reason for us to delete all record of you just let us know, and of course we can do that.</p>


<h4>Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme</h4>
<p align="justify">In the event of any unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure or loss of your personal information that is likely to result in serious harm to you, we will investigate and notify you and act in accordance with the Privacy Act.</p>


<h4>Complaints about your privacy</h4>
<p align="justify">If you believe your privacy has been breached or you have a complaint about how we have handled your personal information, please contact us in writing. We will respond within a reasonable period (usually within 30 days).</p>


<h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>
<p align="justify">(a)We will keep confidential and protect your Personal Information and SPI except where disclosure is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the SPI and Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information and SPI, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)We limit access to SPI and Personal Information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or Services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
<p align="justify">(d)Third parties provide certain services available on our Website and on our behalf. We may provide information, including Personal Information and SPI, to third-party service providers to help us deliver our products, information, and Services efficiently and effectively. Service providers are also an important means by which we maintain our Website and mailing lists. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on our behalf through confidentiality agreements and otherwise. We do not intend to transfer SPI and Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell SPI and Personal Information collected online without consent.</p>
<p align="justify">(e)If you choose to provide us with your SPI and Personal Information, we may transfer that SPI and Personal Information from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your SPI and Personal Information may be collected and stored on servers located in the territory of India and such other countries as we may disclose from time to time.</p>
